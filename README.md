# customer_chur_project
#This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will leave a service (churn) based on demographic and usage behavior. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were applied to maximize churn prediction accuracy.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Goal: Identify customers at risk of leaving and help businesses reduce churn rates.

Key Skills: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Business Insights
